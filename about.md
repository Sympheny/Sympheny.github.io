## About
Sympheny offers a cloud-based software platform to support the planning of renewables-based decentralized energy systems for neighborhoods, districts and cities. Using an innovative data-driven approach, our platform facilitates the realization of optimally efficient and sustainable energy system solutions that effectively exploit the opportunities offered by emerging energy technologies.

For further details on Sympheny concept and decentralized energy systems, please visit the Empa Urban Energy Systems [UES](https://www.empa.ch/web/s313/overview) website.
