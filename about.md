## About
Sympheny offers a cloud-based software platform to support the planning of renewables-based decentralized energy systems for neighborhoods, districts and cities. Using an innovative data-driven approach, our platform facilitates the realization of optimally efficient and sustainable energy system solutions that effectively exploit the opportunities offered by emerging energy technologies.

For further details on Sympheny concept and decentralized energy systems, please visit the Empa Urban Energy Systems [UES](https://www.empa.ch/web/s313/overview) website.

### Team

Dr. Andrew Bollinger is currently a researcher and group leader in the Urban Energy Systems [UES](https://www.empa.ch/web/s313/overview) Laboratory at Empa, Switzerland. He focuses on the development of computational methods for energy systems planning and operation.   
 
Julien Marquant is concluding his PhD thesis at the ETH in ZÃ¼rich in collaboration with the Urban Energy Systems Laboratory at Empa, Switzerland. His research interests concern data analysis, mathematical models and optimisation methods for optimal deployment of distributed energy systems at different scales. 
 
Dr. Stephan Fahlbusch is working as programme manager of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research on Future Energy Efficient Buildings & Districts ([SCCER FEEB&D](http://www.sccer-feebd.ch/)) at Empa, Switzerland. He focuses on building efficient management processes and long lasting client relationships in energy-related projects.
